You will find attached in this repository both databases that I have created in SPSS based on data extracted using both
Javascript and the API provided for the assessment.

You will also find two files providing screenshots of common trends that I have found throughout the data.

I have provided a text based document outlining in text some of the key commonalities I have found throughout both databases.

Finally, you will find the mp4 video that I have created discussing the task assignment
